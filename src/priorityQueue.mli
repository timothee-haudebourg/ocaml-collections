(** Priority queues.

    The [PriorityQueue] module provides a polymorphic and a functorial
    interface to an imperative priority queue data structure.  A queue is
    implemented by embeddeding a heap in a resizable array.

    The polymorphic interface requires that the elements in a priority queue
    are distinct w.r.t. [(=)].  The functorial interface requires that the
    elements in a priority queue are distinct w.r.t. the [equal] function in
    their [HashedType] module.  Otherwise the functions based on element
    values ([mem], [remove], [reorder_up], and [reorder_down]) may not work
    correctly. *)

type 'a order = 'a -> 'a -> bool
(** The type of priority orders on ['a].  A priority order [ord] is a
    non-strict total order where [ord a b = true] means that the priority of
    [b] is not higher than the priority of [a].  When the priority of an
    element changes, the queue must be notified using the [reorder_up] or
    [reorder_down] function. *)

(** The type of priority queues with element type ['a]. *)

val make: 'a order -> 'a t
